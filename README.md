# About App Development 

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. What is an App?

An app, short for application, is a software program designed to perform a specific function or set of functions directly for the user or, in some cases, for another application program. Mobile apps are designed specifically to run on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. They can be downloaded from app stores such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Desktop apps are designed to run on desktop or laptop computers and can be downloaded from various sources such as the Microsoft Store or directly from the developer's website.

### 1.2. What is App Development?

App development is the process of creating a computer program or a set of programs to perform the different tasks that a business requires. From calculating monthly expenses to scheduling sales reports, applications help businesses automate processes and increase efficiency. Every app-building process follows the same steps: gathering requirements, designing prototypes, testing, implementation, and integration.
